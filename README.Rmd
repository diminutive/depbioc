How to depend on Bioconductor? 

The answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14343817/cran-package-depends-on-bioconductor-package-installing-error

We have to do this: 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
```

Then add `biocViews:` to the DESCRIPTION, and the Imports/Suggests we need (`rhdf5` in Imports here and `BiocInstaller` and `zlibbioc` in Suggests). 


Then run these: 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_deps(dependencies = "Suggests")
devtools::install_deps(dependencies = "Imports")
```

Then this will work: 

```{r}
library(depbioc)
runa()
```
